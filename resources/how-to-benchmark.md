10. Before making additional changes, save a bare-bones copy of this map to use for other tests and call it “benchy_”, or any name you want.

11. You are now ready to set up maps to test and compare. To make this easier you should download and use the mod called “Region Cloner” (more info: https://mods.factorio.com/mod/region-cloner ) to make numerous copies of your design easily, including the state of machines, bots in roboports, trains with cargo, sciences with research, and much more than just an in-game copy and paste. Only clone straight-aligned trains, not trains that are on a curved rail. Trains stopped close together might bug too and merge. You can download this in-game using the “Mods” button on the main menu.

Note: Most mistakes while benchmarking will come from improper setup of your test maps. Double and triple check your test maps before and after benchmarking to check for bugs or mistakes in the cloning process. After a clone, look for overlapping roboports or missing electrical connections for example. Remember to use /editor and pause the game using the time tab. In the time tab you can advance tick by tick or set a # of ticks to run before pausing the game again. Your benchmarks will start at the exact time of the saved map.
